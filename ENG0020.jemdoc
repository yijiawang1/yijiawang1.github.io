# == Lecture Notes
# Lecture 1. 

== Recitations
Quizzes will be taken during the recitation. Each student can make up two quizzes at most for the whole semester. If a student has surpassed this number, then each additionally missed quiz will be counted as a zero in the grade except for extreme cases.

== Homeworks
There will be weekly homework assignments for this class. Typically, the homework will be announced by Thursday, and is due by noon on the next Thursday. Homework can either be submitted to the instructor in class or sent to the instructor's mailbox in 1025D, Benedum Hall. Collaboration on solving the homework is allowed, after you have thought about the problems on your own. It is also OK to get clarification (but not solutions) from books or online resources, again after you have thought about the problems on your own. You should write your solution independently.
